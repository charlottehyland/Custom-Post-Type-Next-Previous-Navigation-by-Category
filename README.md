# Custom Post Type Next Previous Navigation by Custom Taxonomy
WordPress: For custom post types, where you want to link to the next/previous posts within the same custom taxonomy. Uses Advanced Custom Fields.

In this example, we have a custom post type of People, and a custom taxonomy of Practice Areas. If you are on a particular Practice Area page, the client wanted to navigate through all people who are assigned to that particular practice area. So if you were navigating to an individual person's bio page from a particular Practice Area page, the next/previous links should only show you other people within that same practice area.

We also have a more general next/previous setup for if you're just navigating through all people, and doesn't consider the practice area, just links to everyone alphabetically by last name (which is a custom field)
